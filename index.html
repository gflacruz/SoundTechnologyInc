            <p>I took my Marantz receiver to this shop and they were absolutely great.  They were very professional and courteous.  They clearly explained their process and expected time to diagnosis the issue.  When they called to advise of the required repairs, they explained everything really well.
              Their services are reasonably priced considering they are subject matter experts and take good care of your item.</p>
              <br>
              <p>I will definitely continue to come here with any of my audio repairs, as well as recommend this place to anyone I know.</p>

            <p>Just had my 1980's model Hitachi HA~3800 amplifier repaired and it sounds great. The repair took about a week and a half just like Willy said it would. Next time I need electronic equipment repairs I will be back. Once again, GREAT JOB!</p>
